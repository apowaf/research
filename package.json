### 2. The Final `netlify.toml` (Updated)

Now, we will simplify your `netlify.toml` file to use the new root `package.json` we just created.

* In the **root of your project (`FINALS`)**, replace the entire contents of your `netlify.toml` file with this final version.


```toml
# netlify.toml

# This file now correctly configures the build for a monorepo structure.

[build]
  # The root 'package.json' handles the 'npm install' and 'npm run build' commands.
  # Netlify will run 'npm install' and then 'npm run build' from the root.
  command = "npm install && npm run build"
  
  # The directory containing the serverless functions, relative to the root.
  functions = "backend/functions"
  
  # The directory to publish, relative to the root.
  # The root 'build' script builds the frontend into this folder.
  publish = "frontend/build"

# Optional: Redirect all non-API requests to the React app's index.html
# This is crucial for handling client-side routing in React.
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
  # Exclude the API path from being redirected.
  conditions = {Path = ["!/.netlify/functions/*"]}
